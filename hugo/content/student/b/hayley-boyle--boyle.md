please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "As an artist I aim to produce imagery and associations that bounce around creating new connections. I'm interested in the visual overload and works that envelop the viewer. As the brain often has many thoughts and networks all competing at once so do my paintings. I conjure into the world vivid dreamscapes and anchor down the fleeting memories of psychedelia. I aim to break out what sits in our subconscious and investigate microcosms, getting to better understand what weaves the threads of our reality. In my exhibition Frequency Plane, each painting pulls you into the centre acting as a portal into new worlds and through associations into new ideas and mindscapes."
